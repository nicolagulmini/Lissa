# Lissa
Lissa is a macOS application for generating and visualizing Lissajous figures. 
It allows you to explore the properties of these mathematical curves by interactively changing their defining parameters, both visually and through audio sine wave generation.

Download it [here](https://github.com/nicolagulmini/Lissa/raw/refs/heads/main/Lissa.zip).

## Features

- Dynamic visualization of Lissajous curves.
- Interactive control of parameters:
  - Amplitudes (A, B)
  - Frequencies (a, b)
  - Phase (Î´)
  - Line width
  - Curve color
  - Instability and "hand-drawn" movement on X and Y axes
- Static and dynamic modes (synchronized with audio).
- Start/stop audio sine wave generation.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the curve parameters.
3. Press the "Play/Pause" button to start or stop the audio sine waves.
4. Enable "Static Figure" mode to display a static curve.
5. Customize the curve's color and line width using the dedicated controls.

## Requirements

- macOS
- (Xcode if you wanna build it from the source code)
